        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
          Many UW students want to sell or buy used items like textbooks, furniture, or gadgets, but current platforms don’t feel safe or practical. Apps like eBay or Craigslist don’t verify users, making it hard to know if the person you’re dealing with is trustworthy. These platforms are often perceived as unsafe due to scams and lack of accountability (Inverse). They also aren’t focused on the UW community, where trust and convenience are higher priorities.
          <br>
          <br>
          Facebook groups like “UW Buy and Sell” try to help but are messy and unorganized. It’s hard to find specific items, and anyone can join, so there’s no guarantee you’re dealing with a fellow student. Platforms like Facebook Marketplace also have vulnerabilities like scams, which discourage users from participating (Garbo). Additionally, existing platforms don’t address concerns like high shipping costs or the need for environmentally sustainable practices, both of which are important for students looking to save money and reduce waste.
          <br>
          <br>
          The main issue is the lack of a platform tailored specifically for UW students. A better app could verify users with UW emails, organize listings for easier browsing, and focus on face-to-face transactions to cut shipping costs and foster sustainability. Such an app would create a more trustworthy, efficient, and eco-friendly marketplace while strengthening the campus community.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
          DawgBay is a web application that provides a convenient and sustainable platform for college students to buy and sell used goods.
           It creates an easily accessible marketplace for trading items like clothes, electronics, books, and basic household goods to help
            users save money while reducing waste, considering the financial constraints of college students.
            <br>
            <br>
            DawgBay makes it easier by enabling students to post items for sale and browse available items within their campus community.
            By encouraging face-to-face interactions, the platform cuts down on the major costs associated with shipping, making transactions affordable
            and environmentally sustainable. It also fosters a sense of community by connecting students through sustainable practice and promotes the
            reuse of these used items.

        <h3>Interactive Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Listing/Managing Items (Feature 1):
            Students can create a listing for their unused items by filling out a form with details such as item name,
            description, condition, category, price and uploading a picture of the item.
            Users can manage their active listings, including editing or removing items that have been sold.
          </li>
          <li>Feedback and Rating System (Feature 2):
            Users can rate their purchasing experience when buying their desired item, which can be 1 or two of these things:
            Transaction-Based Ratings: Users rate their purchasing experience on a 1-5 scale, which will help to highlight positive interactions or flag potential issues.
            Detailed Reviews: Users can write “optional” written comments that will allow them to share specific details about their transactions, which will promote transparency and accountability.
          </li>
          <li>Wishlist and item Alerts (Feature 3):
            Users can add items they want to a wishlist for easy tracking.
            The app sends notifications when items on a user's wishlist are marked down in price, or sold.
          </li>
          <li>Search and Filter Functionality (Half-feature):
            The app has basic search and filter options (e.g. by category or price range) to help users find items.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data and Impact</h3>
        <p>
          The app will store user-generated listings and feedback using a database, ensuring data persistence.
          It will address the problem of affordability and accessibility for UW students, offering a hyper-localized marketplace.
