        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
          DawgBay is a web application that provides a convenient and sustainable platform for college students to buy and sell used goods.
           It creates an easily accessible marketplace for trading items like clothes, electronics, books, and basic household goods to help
            users save money while reducing waste, considering the financial constraints of college students.
            <br>
            <br>
            DawgBay makes it easier by enabling students to post items for sale and browse available items within their campus community.
            By encouraging face-to-face interactions, the platform cuts down on the major costs associated with shipping, making transactions affordable
            and environmentally sustainable. It also fosters a sense of community by connecting students through sustainable practice and promotes the
            reuse of these used items.
        </p>
        <h3>Interactive Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Listing/Managing Items (Feature 1):
            Students can create a listing for their unused items by filling out a form with details such as item name,
            description, condition, category, price and uploading a picture of the item.
            Users can manage their active listings, including editing or removing items that have been sold.
          </li>
          <li>Feedback and Rating System (Feature 2):
            Users can rate their purchasing experience when buying their desired item, which can be 1 or two of these things:
            Transaction-Based Ratings: Users rate their purchasing experience on a 1-5 scale, which will help to highlight positive interactions or flag potential issues.
            Detailed Reviews: Users can write “optional” written comments that will allow them to share specific details about their transactions, which will promote transparency and accountability.
          </li>
          <li>Wishlist and item Alerts (Feature 3):
            Users can add items they want to a wishlist for easy tracking.
            The app sends notifications when items on a user's wishlist are marked down in price, or sold.
          </li>
          <li>Search and Filter Functionality (Half-feature):
            The app has basic search and filter options (e.g. by category or price range) to help users find items.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data and Impact</h3>
        <p>
          The app will store user-generated listings and feedback using a database, ensuring data persistence.
          It will address the problem of affordability and accessibility for UW students, offering a hyper-localized marketplace.
